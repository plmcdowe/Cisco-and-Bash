## [ 1 ] **Intro:**   
IOS.sh has been available in Cisco since *early* IOS 15.    
It is a shell environment that peels back the Cisco CLI, allowing many familiar Bash/Shell commands.   
IOS.sh can be enabled epehmerally with: `terminal shell` from privileged exec.     
Or, it can be configured as a permenant feature with:
```
conf t
shell processing full
```    
I chose the `shell processing full` route.    
With the feature enabled, you can save and load "shell environments", stored in bootflash.     
(More on this later).    

The documentation from Cisco isn't *great*... and, posts I've found online are from folks who either -       
* copypasta from the Cisco doc's or,      
* *hardly* scrape the surface of this feature's capabilities.       

So, I put this readme togther with progressively more advanced examples and practical implementations.   
These examples should help make better sense of the Shell environments [ SWCFG ](https://github.com/plmcdowe/Cisco-and-Bash/blob/b8ec35e9fc6876c00d25d746d1dbb7792a7b0706/SWCFG.sh) and [ SWFIX ](https://github.com/plmcdowe/Cisco-and-Bash/blob/b8ec35e9fc6876c00d25d746d1dbb7792a7b0706/SWFIX.sh) in this repository.         
     
I won't be deliberately covering any regex basics.      
At times, I may point out a basic regex concept for the sake of explaining IOS.sh mechanics.    
I highly recommend these excellent resources: [ REXEG ](https://www.rexegg.com/regex-quickstart.php) | [ TLDP, Basic Regex ](https://tldp.org/LDP/Bash-Beginners-Guide/html/chap_04.html) | [ TLDP, Advanced Regex ](https://tldp.org/LDP/abs/html/abs-guide.html#REGEXP)

>> There's the problem! It returns `grep [pattern that fails to match]`
>>     
>> So, 3 main ways to handle this, with additional options to implement that I won't dive into here:
>> 1. Store the cmd return in a variable, then `if [[ "$V" != "grep" && $V =~ "17.12.04" ]]; then ...`
>>    * Can be useful if you need the version later, otherwise, `if` and `booleans` *marginally "slow"* things down.
>>           
>> 2. Use `!` for "not match": ```if [[ ! `sh ve|grep  '17.12.04a'` =~ "grep" ]]```
>>    * A little convoluted, but valid - I've had to use simliar before.
>>           
>> 3. Use `i` for `include` instead of `grep` because Cisco's built in parser return's nothing.
>>    * Likely the best option in this case: ```if [[ `sh ve | i 17.12.04a` ]]```

> ### [ 2.3 ] <ins>Setup for FIPS check and config</ins> ðŸ”Ž
>> FIPS mode is *huge* in DoDIN compliance. Failure to run routers, switches, WLCs, etc. in FIPS mode results in:
>>> * A CAT-1 per device discovered to not be in FIPS {rule ID varied by device family}
>>> * A Key Indicator of Risk (KIOR)
>>>   * KIORs were added in Command Cyber Readiness Inspection (CCRI 3.0)
>>>   * If your enterprise recieves arbitrarily too many KIORs,\
>>>       your enterprise (state of Indiana in my case) will be disconnected.
>>>   * Certain KIORs are easy to remediate (non-secure services/protocols: FTP)
>>>     * others are difficult (FIPS),
>>>     * some are impossible (replacing EOL devices mid-CCRI).
>>     
>> What follows is the build up to a function to check for and configure FIPS. The steps are:
>>> 1. Check if the switch is a stack:
>>>    * If a stack, it must be unstacked, FIPS configured on each individual switch, then restacked..
>>>    * Obviously, requires touch labor, can't proceed remotely through the script.     
>>> 2. If non-stack, check if already running in FIPS mode.
>>> 3. If already running FIPS, do nothing. If not running FIPS.
>>> 4. Check for a FIPS key.
>>>    * If there is a FIPS key, the switch just needs to be reloaded.
>>>    * If there is no FIPS key, configure the key; reload the switch.
>>    
>> Let's check for a stack:     
>> ```bash
>> # Full: ( show switch	)
>> # Shortest: sh sw
>> # Quickly tell if a switch is a stack:
>>   sh sw | e \\*
>>   # or
>>   sh sw|grep ^[[:blank:]][[:digit:]]
>> ```
>>> ![stack-sh-sw-e-R](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0c28ef97-98e6-4862-95d4-5dec5f44a908)    
>>> ![stack-sh-sw-grep-R](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5ee3aef1-62cd-4b2a-b1eb-bcd4016c3ce7)     
>>    
>> Now, let's consider what we learned earlier about `if` tests directly on a command's return.    
>> `sh sw | e \\*` is going to give us trouble.    
>> No matter what, it will always return the formatted Switch MAC & column headers.    
>> We can more easily work around a bum `grep` return than that default Cisco output.    
>> ```bash
>> function stack(){
>>  if [[ ! `sh sw|grep ^[[:blank:]][[:digit:]]` =~ "grep" ]]; then printf '\nSTACK\n';
>>    else printf '\nNOT A STACK\n'; fi;
>> }
>> ```
>>> ![not-a-stack-func-R](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5588f6b6-b561-45da-a068-5d0e7cd8b3ff)
>>
>> Sweet, not a stack - let's proceed to step 2. checking FIPS status and key:    
>> ```bash
>> # Full: ( show fips [authorization-key || status] )
>> # Shortest: ( sh fip a || sh fip s )
>>   sh fip a
>>    # "FIPS: No key installed."
>>   sh fip s
>>    # "Switch and Stacking are not running in fips mode"
>> ```
>>
>> Easy enough, we'll check based on 'not' and 'no'. Let's skip ahead to the complete function:     
>> ```bash
>> function fips(){
>>  if [[ ! `sh sw|grep ^[[:blank:]][[:digit:]]` =~ "grep" ]]; then printf '\n\nSTACK\n';
>>    else printf '\n\nNOT A STACK\n'
>>     if [[ `sh fip s | i not` ]]; then printf '\nNot in FIPS mode: CAT-1 + KIOR\n';
>>      if [[ `sh fip a | i no` ]]; then printf '\n  No FIPS Key configured\n'; 
>>       else printf '\n  FIPS Key configured, reload to put in FIPS mode\n\n'; fi; 
>>     else printf '\nFIPS mode enabled\n'; fi;
>>  fi
>> }
>> ```
